            Avatar: The Last Airbender is set in a world where human
            civilization consists of four nations, named after the four
            classical elements: the Water Tribes, the Earth Kingdom, the Fire
            Nation, and the Air Nomads. In each nation, certain people, known as
            "benders" (waterbenders, earthbenders, firebenders and airbenders),
            have the ability to telekinetically manipulate and control the
            element corresponding to their nation, using gestures based on
            Chinese martial arts. The "Avatar" is the only individual with the
            ability to bend all four elements.
          </p>
          <p class="series__description">
            The Avatar is an international arbiter whose duty is to maintain
            harmony among the four nations, and act as a mediator between humans
            and spirits. When the Avatar dies, their spirit is reincarnated in a
            new body, who will be born to parents in the next nation in a set
            order known as the Avatar cycle: Fire, Air, Water, and Earth. By
            tradition, the new Avatar will travel the world to learn all four
            bending arts, after which they will begin in earnest their role as
            global peacekeeper. The Avatar can enter a condition known as the
            "Avatar State", in which they temporarily gain the skills and
            knowledge of all their past incarnations. Although this is when they
            are at their most powerful, if the Avatar was ever killed while in
            the Avatar State, the reincarnation cycle would be broken and the
            Avatar would cease to exist.
